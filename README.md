Text-to-Python Code Chatbot
This project is a chatbot designed to generate Python code from natural language instructions. 
It leverages the iamtarun/python_code_instructions_18k_alpaca dataset and a fine-tuned GPT-based model to interpret user queries and produce accurate Python code solutions. 
The chatbot is built using Python, Hugging Face's transformers library, and Flask for a lightweight API interface.

Features:
Understands natural language instructions.
Generates Python code snippets on demand.
Easy-to-extend architecture for fine-tuning and additional features.

How It Works:
Input a natural language instruction (e.g., "Write a Python function to calculate the factorial of a number").
The model processes the instruction and generates the corresponding Python code.
The result is returned as a response via an API endpoint.
This project is ideal for developers looking to explore AI-powered code generation.
